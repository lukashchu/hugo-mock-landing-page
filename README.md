# Opus Landing Page

A mock landing page for **Opus**, a revolutionary crowdsourcing platform that leverages AI and automation to deliver higher-quality, faster responses compared to traditional platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Opus landing page, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The site showcases key features of Opus—such as higher payouts, faster response times, and gamified incentives—while emphasizing how Opus is reshaping the crowdsourcing landscape. All of this was created as a part of my course work for CIS 3500: Software Design/Engineering with Professor Lumbroso at the University of Pennsylvania
